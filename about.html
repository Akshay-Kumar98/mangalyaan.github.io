                <p>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan ("Mars-craft", from mangala, "Mars" and yāna,
                    "craft, vehicle"), is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5
                    November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is India's first interplanetary
                    mission and it made it the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the
                    European Space Agency. It made India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first
                    nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt.

                    The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre
                    (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25
                    at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013. The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28
                    October 2013. The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven
                    apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC). After a
                    298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.

                    The mission is a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing,
                    planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission. It carries five scientific
                    instruments. The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO
                    Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from the Indian Deep
                    Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Bengaluru, Karnataka.</p>

                <p>The total cost of the mission was approximately ₹450 Crore (US$73 million), making it the
                    least-expensive Mars mission to date. The low cost of the mission was ascribed by K. Radhakrishnan,
                    the chairman of ISRO, to various factors, including a "modular approach", few ground tests and long
                    (18–20 hour) working days for scientists. BBC's Jonathan Amos mentioned lower worker costs,
                    home-grown technologies, simpler design, and a significantly less complicated payload than NASA's

                    <p><strong>MAVEN</strong> is an American spacecraft orbiting Mars to study the loss of its
                        atmospheric gases to space, providing insight into the history of the planet's climate and
                        water. The spacecraft name is an acronym for "Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution" and also a
                        word that means "a person who has special knowledge or experience; an expert". MAVEN was
                        launched on an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, on 18 November
                        2013 UTC and went into orbit around Mars on 22 September 2014 UTC. The mission is the first by
                        NASA to study the Mars atmosphere. The probe is analyzing the planet's upper atmosphere and
                        ionosphere to examine how and at what rate the solar wind is stripping away volatile compounds.
                        <br><br>
                        The principal investigator for the mission is Shannon Curry at the University of California,
                        Berkeley. She took over from Bruce Jakosky of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics
                        at the University of Colorado Boulder, who proposed and led the mission until 2021. The project
                        cost $582.5 million to build, launch, and operate through its two-year prime mission.
                        <br><br>

                        On 1 October 2013, only seven weeks before launch, a government shutdown caused suspension of
                        work for two days and initially threatened to force a 26-month postponement of the mission. With
                        the spacecraft nominally scheduled to launch on 18 November 2013, a delay beyond 7 December 2013
                        would have caused MAVEN to miss the launch window as Mars moved too far out of alignment with
                        the Earth.

            <p>ISRO originally intended to launch Mangalyaan on their Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV)
                rocket instead of the only roughly half as powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). As with most
                Mars missions, a GSLV rocket could’ve boosted Mangalyaan out of Earth orbit and onto an interplanetary
                trajectory to the Red Planet. But the rocket suffered two failures in 2010, just as Mangalyaan was being
                conceptualized.
                <br><br>
                Fixing the identified issues in the rocket’s design and preparing for another launch could take at least
                three years, placing it eerily close to the time-sensitive November 2013 launch window for Mars. The
                next launch opportunity was in 2016 so ISRO decided to launch Mangalyaan on a PSLV rocket in 2013
                instead.
                <br><br>
                However, the PSLV could only place Mangalyaan in a highly elliptical Earth orbit. It would be the
                spacecraft’s job to fire its engines at precise points in each orbit multiple times over the next few
                weeks to set itself on a trajectory to Mars, or it would miss the planet entirely. The trajectory design
                was highly unusual for a Mars mission but it worked. Once the spacecraft arrived at the Red Planet
                roughly 300 days later, it fired its engines again and successfully entered Mars orbit.

                    <p>Previous missions to Mars have investigated the surface history of the Red Planet by examining
                        features like canyons, volcanoes, rocks and soil. However, signatures of the planet's formation
                        can only be found by sensing and studying its "vital signs" far below the surface.

                        In comparison to the other terrestrial planets, Mars is neither too big nor too small. This
                        means that it preserves the record of its formation and can give us insight into how the
                        terrestrial planets formed. It is the perfect laboratory from which to study the formation and
                        evolution of rocky planets. Scientists know that Mars has low levels of geological activity. But
                        a lander like InSight can also reveal just how active Mars really is.</p>

            <h2>Trajectory</h2>

            <p>Four trajectory corrections were originally planned, but only three were carried out. The first
                trajectory correction manoeuvre (TCM) was carried out on 11 December 2013 at 01:00 UTC by firing the
                22-newton (4.9 lbf) thrusters for a duration of 40.5 seconds. After this event, MOM was following the
                designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in April 2014 was not
                required. The second trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on 11 June 2014 at 11:00 UTC by
                firing the spacecraft's 22 newton thrusters for 16 seconds. The third planned trajectory correction
                manoeuvre was postponed, due to the orbiter's trajectory closely matching the planned trajectory. The
                third trajectory correction was also a deceleration test 3.9 seconds long on 22 September 2014</p>

                    <h4>Geo Centric Phase</h4>
                    <p>The spacecraft is injected into an Elliptic Parking Orbit by the launcher. With six main engine
                        burns, the spacecraft is gradually maneuvered into a departure hyperbolic trajectory with which
                        it escapes from the Earth’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) with Earth’s orbital velocity + V boost.
                        The SOI of earth ends at 918347 km from the surface of the earth beyond which the perturbing
                        force on the orbiter is mainly due to the Sun. One primary concern is how to get the spacecraft
                        to Mars, on the least amount of fuel. ISRO uses a method of travel called a Hohmann Transfer
                        Orbit – or a Minimum Energy Transfer Orbit – to send a spacecraft from Earth to Mars with the
                        least amount of fuel possible.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h4>Helio Centric Phase</h4>
                    <p>The spacecraft leaves Earth in a direction tangential to Earth’s orbit and encounters Mars
                        tangentially to its orbit. The flight path is roughly one half of an ellipse around sun.
                        Eventually it will intersect the orbit of Mars at the exact moment when Mars is there too. This
                        trajectory becomes possible with certain allowances when the relative position of Earth, Mars
                        and Sun form an angle of approximately 44o. Such an arrangement recur periodically at intervals
                        of about 780 days. Minimum energy opportunities for Earth-Mars occur in November 2013, January
                        2016, May2018 etc.</p>

                    <h4>Martian Phase</h4>

                    <p>The spacecraft arrives at the Mars Sphere of Influence (around 573473 km from the surface of
                        Mars) in a hyperbolic trajectory. At the time the spacecraft reaches the closest approach to
                        Mars (Periapsis), it is captured into planned orbit around mars by imparting ∆V retro which is
                        called the Mars Orbit Insertion (MOI) manoeuvre. The Earth-Mars trajectory is shown in the above
                        figure. ISRO plans to launch the Mars Orbiter Mission during the November 2013 window utilizing
                        minimum energy transfer opportunity.</p>

            <p>Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (MOM 2), also called Mangalyaan-2 ("Mars-craft", from Sanskrit: मंगल mangal,
                "Mars" and यान yān, "craft, vehicle"), is India's second interplanetary mission planned by the Indian
                Space Research Organisation (ISRO). In a recorded interview in October 2019, Vikram Sarabhai Space
                Centre (VSSC) director indicated possibility of inclusion of a lander but in an interview to The Times
                Of India in February 2021 ISRO chairman clarified that the mission will consist only an orbiter. The
                orbiter will use aerobraking to lower its initial apoapsis and enter into an orbit more suitable for
                observations. Indian Space Research Organisation plans to launch this mission by 2025.</p>

            <p>An Announcement of Opportunity was released requesting submissions for scientific instruments for an
                orbiter only, with a deadline set for 20 September 2016.[16][17] The total science payload mass is
                estimated at 100 kg (220 lb).[1]
                <br><br>
                One of the science payloads under development is an ionosphere plasma instrument named ARIS. It is being
                developed by Space Satellite Systems and Payloads Centre (SSPACE), which is part of the Indian Institute
                of Space Science and Technology (IIST). The engineering model and high vacuum test have been
